title: 1.3 - Doing Something
---
This tutorial assumes you have already
- Read the [Pre-requisites](/tutorials/Pre-requisites)
- Downloaded the latest Forge MDK
- Setup your mod folder as described at the top of [the main Forge 1.14.4 tutorials page](/tutorials/1.14.4/forge/)
- Read and followed [1.0 - Gradle Configuration](/tutorials/1.14.4/forge/1.0-gradle-configuration/)
- Read and followed [1.1 - Importing the project into your IDE](/tutorials/1.14.4/forge/1.1-importing-project/)
- Read and followed [1.2 - Basic Mod](/tutorials/1.14.4/forge/1.2-basic-mod/)

Our mod currently doesn't do anything. Lets change that and print something to the log!  

To start off, make a `public` constructor with no arguments/parameters with nothing in it
> Access levels  
> Access level modifiers determine whether other classes can reference a particular class, use a particular field, or invoke a particular method. Having our constructor be `public` allows Forge to call it and create our mod.
> - `public` Can be accessed by any class
> - `protected` Can only be accessed by its own class or subclasses
> - *package-private* (no explicit modifier) Can only be accessed by classes in the same package
> - `private` Can only be accessed in its own class
>
> [More info](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html)

> Constructors  
> A class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects from the class blueprint. Constructor declarations look like method declarationsâ€”except that they use the name of the class and have no return type.  
> [More info](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/constructors.html)

Now make a constant logger for your mod  
`public static final Logger LOGGER = LogManager.getLogger(MODID);` (import the `log4j` logger not the `java.util` one)  
Then in your constructor call `LOGGER.debug("Hello from YourModName!");`  
For eclipse people, you'll need to refresh `/src/`  
Now run your game again and you should be able to see "Hello from YourModName!" in your log  
![Log](./log.png "Log")
Your final code should look something like
```java
package io.github.cadiboo.examplemod;

import net.minecraftforge.fml.common.Mod;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

@Mod(ExampleMod.MODID)
public final class ExampleMod {

	public static final String MODID = "examplemod";

	public static final Logger LOGGER = LogManager.getLogger(MODID);

	public ExampleMod() {
		LOGGER.debug("Hello from Example Mod!");
	}

}
```
