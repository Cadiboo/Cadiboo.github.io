What: Lowercase package naming.
Why: Some file systems (windows) consider `iTeMs` and `items` to be the same, but every other system considers them to be different.
Consequences: Not doing this _may_ never cause any issues (and very likely won't in your dev environment), but on other operating systems with different case-sensitivities from yours this can cause massive problems.
How: Name your packages all in lowercase.

What: Packaging that reflects your web presence.
Why: Avoid name collisions - your web presence is unique so it is commonly used.
Consequences: Errors loading classes with other mods installed, usually happens when 2 mods never changed their packaging from the default in the MDK.
How: If you have an illegal character in your web presence, the convention is to replace it with `_`. If you don’t have a website, you can use your version-control repository as your web presence, e.g. `com.github.username`. If you don’t use version control, start using it! In the meantime you can use the packaging `mod.username.modid`.
