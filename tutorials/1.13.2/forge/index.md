## Read the [Pre-requisites](https://cadiboo.github.io/tutorials/Pre-requisites) first!

To start off, Download the [Forge MDK (Mod Development Kit)](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.13.2.html), unzip it to an accessible folder and rename it to the file name of your mod. I put my mods in `/Users/Cadiboo/Developer/Modding/<Mod File Name>`.  
Your mod file name must not contain spaces. Spaces should be removed or replaced with `-`.  
Some Examples of mod file names are 
- NoCubes
- JourneyMap
- Tinkers-Construct
- Inventory-Tweaks
- RenderChunk-rebuildChunk-Hooks

Open up that folder and continue to Chapter 1.
