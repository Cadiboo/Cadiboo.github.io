# Step 1 - Learn Java
It is ***HIGHLY RECCOMENDED*** that you learn Java before attempting to make a mod. Even 2 hours learning about it before trying to make a mod help immeasurably. You can learn about Java many ways. Here are some Java tutorials I reccomend:
- [javatpoint.com/java-tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial)
It is also reccomended, however not neccesary, that you know about Java Reflection and Java Streams

# Step 2 - Install the latest Java 8 JDK (Java Development Kit)
Install the latest Java 8 JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).  
***Download the 64 bit (x64) version, not the 32 bit (x86) version!!!***

# Step 3 - Follow the Tutorial
Follow the appropriate setup tutorial from [here](https://cadiboo.github.io/tutorials/)
