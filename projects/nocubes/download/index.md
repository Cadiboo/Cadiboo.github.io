## CurseForge (Stable)
- [NoCubes 1.12.2](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/nocubes/files)
- [RenderChunk rebuildChunk Hooks](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/renderchunk-rebuildchunk-hooks/files) (Required by NoCubes)


## IMPORTANT
Donâ€™t forget that the lighting is set based on your video settings, but everything else is changed from on the mods config which can be found at Mod List > NoCubes > Config

There are a bunch of cool options in the config that can make the visuals a lot better. (Beautify textures, change the rendering algorithm, smooth liquids etc.)
