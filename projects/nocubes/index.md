### [Download](/projects/nocubes/download)
Download the mod here

### [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zKP8EgY)
Get support, development updates, pre-releases and much, much more on our discord server.

### ToDo List
- [x] Performance (Upgraded by 61x)
- [x] Smooth lighting (Works perfectly!)
- [ ] CullFacing Issues
- [ ] Collisions (Part of the code is written, needs optimisation)


### Screenshots (There are much better ones in #gallery on the discord server!)
