### [Download](/projects/nocubes/download)

### [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zKP8EgY)
Get installation support, ingame support, development updates, a big screenshot gallery, the list of implemented & planned features for the mod and the todo list of the mod (accurate block collisions, texture connecting/joining/fading/merging) on our server.
The server is also a place to tell me your feature requests/suggestions/opinions and to just chat about the mod and similar stuff.

### ToDo List
- [x] Performance (Upgraded by 61x)
- [x] Smooth lighting (Works perfectly!)
- [ ] CullFacing Issues
- [ ] Collisions (Part of the code is written, needs optimisation)


### Screenshots (There are much better ones in #gallery on the discord server!)
